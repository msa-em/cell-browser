Representative microscopy images are visual communication tools used by microscopists to present the results of research to other scientists.
The earliest representative microscopy images were hand drawings in [Micrographia](<wiki:Micrographia>) in 1665 by Robert Hooke.
Nowadays, roughly three-quarters of publications in biomedical journals report at least one microscopy image [@doi:10.7554/eLife.55133].
In scientific journals, microscopists present stereotypical images of described phenomena in static figures.
An un-spoken rule is that scientists trust that representative images are honest and accurate.
However, microscopy image selection and quantitative analyses thereof are vulnerable to bias and deception [@doi:10.1242/jcs.261567].
Aside from issues with integrity, scientists sincerely misinterpret observations.
The problem is that it is difficult for readers to critically evaluate representative images in static figures.
Furthermore, archival and review of primary microscopy data is disorganized and time-consuming if at all available.

Virtual nanoscopy was an innovative visualization strategy for unbiased presentation of transmission electron microscopy data [@doi:10.1083/jcb.201201140].
It used digital map software developed for satellite images to present high-magnification tiled microscopy data in an interactive viewer, like Google Earth for cell biologists.
In practice, it is easy to implement [@doi:10.1242/jcs.262198] but difficult to publish because scientific journals use static figures.
This project introduces embedded microscopy maps as a proof of principle to share immunofluorescence bioimaging data without external links or software.

Microscopists contribute to the [reproducibility crisis](<wiki:Replication_crisis>) in science, which is being adressed through protocol standardization [@doi:10.1111/jmi.13041].
From the perspective of most biomedical researchers, the perceived cause is the pressure to publish [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3002870].
Large-scale replicability studies performed by scientists at Amgen and Bayer assessed that 11% [@doi:10.1038/483531a] and 25% [@doi:10.1038/nrd3439-c1] of key findings from preclinical cancer research papers were robust and replicable.
Another reproducibility project evaluated replication success with several criteria, though the 'lowest bar' determined a replication rate of 79% for representative images [@doi:10.7554/eLife.71601]. 
Notably, 26% of claimed effects were evidenced by a representative image without quantitative analysis.
Consider that representative images cannot describe population variation and the uncertainty of an observation.

A study critical of representative microscopy images focused on methods of objective image selection to limit bias (https://doi.org/10.1016/s0006-3495(99)77379-0).
The authors implemented a web server that chose typical images from uploaded data, but it is now unsupported and there is no modern equivalent.
This article started by revisiting the idea of objective image selection, as Barkley and Parker thought it was an interesting use case for artificial intelligence.
Barkley automated the process of sample collection and image selection from a collection of one million single-cell images of the [cell nucleus](<wiki:Cell_nucleus>), called _NucleusNet_.
Cropped images from NucleusNet were presented in interactive figures, including embedded microscopy maps using free and open-source technology [@doi:10.1242/jcs.262198].
Representative images were selected from NucleusNet by an [autoencoder](<wiki:Autoencoder>) model.
Autoencoders are unsupervised deep learning models that compress and reconstruct images through a vector bottleneck referred to as _latent space_.
The structure of latent space is a [black box](<wiki:Black_box>), though it can be shaped to be more useful with the art of representation learning [@doi:10.1109/TPAMI.2013.50].
Barkley determined that it would be irresponsible to use an uninterpretable embedding for the task of image selection. 
To define what is representative, both the subjective determinations made by humans and the objective determinations made by autoencoders are opaque.
Therefore, this project shifted towards demonstrations of virtual nanoscopy as an alternative to image selection.
Barkley saw the value of using virtual nanoscopy to replicate microscopy experiments and challenged the claim of reovirus-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) organelle remodelling.
[OrganelleBox](https://organellebox.sf.czbiohub.org/), was used for cross-validation and to expand the investigation to study sixteen organelles during reovirus infection to create an atlas of bioimaging data.

## Definitions

_Virtual nanoscopy_ was a term used to describe the process of automated image acquisition, followed by unbiased presentation in an interactive tile-based viewer. [@doi:10.1083/jcb.201201140]

_Microscopy map_ is the interactive figure used to view virtual nanoscopy data. [@doi:10.1083/jcb.201201140]
The original term '_electron_ microscopy map' was redefined to fit a broader use case because our study used confocal microscopy data.

A _representative image_ is defined as a visual communication tool used by microscopists to communicate research findings to other scientists.
This definition is agnostic to the research context and it emphasizes the use of pictures as scientific evidence.
Parker suggested that _stereotypical image_ would be an apt name for the current use of representative images.

A _grayscale image_ is defined as a two-dimensional matrix where each pixel is a single intensity value ranging from $0-1$ that represents the amount of light or intensity information at a specific point [@doi:10.1109/BIP60195.2023.10379342].

A _latent space_ is a collection of vectors that form a reduced-dimensionality embedding of the data, fit by a machine learning model [@doi:10.1111/cgf.13672].
